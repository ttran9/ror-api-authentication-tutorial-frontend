# Overview

- This repository will be my following along this video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgYiyoyNPrv_yNp5Pzsx0A3gQ8-tfg66j).
    - The front-end portion starts at video 5 so the initial master branch will be the changes up to the end of video 5.

- I will be creating branches for each individual video. 

- The repository with the corresponding back-end code is [here](https://github.com/ttran9/ror-api-authentication-tutorial).
